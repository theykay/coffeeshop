        <h1>SPRUDGE: COFFEE NEWS & CULTURE</h1>

          In the revitalized neighborhood of Liberty Heights is a small grocery
          store peddling locally-sourced, organic food and, just outside, locals
          were drawn to an unassuming hand-built coffee cart--Three Pines
          Coffee—that operated there for the last several months. A labor of
          love from Nick Price (formerly of Handsome Coffee Roasters and
          Blacktop) and his partner, Meg Frampton, Three Pines Coffee was born
          out of two musicians’ adventures in Los Angeles and their decision to
          take those adventures back home, to Salt Lake City.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frampton and Price originally moved to Los Angeles to pursue their
          musical careers. Price started working in coffee—at the now defunct
          Handsome Coffee Roasters—after his handyman skills landed him a job
          offer. Frampton hand-crafted jewelry and sold it at local art and
          craft fairs. Both continued to play music, but as Price got deeper
          into coffee, he and Frampton started to notice that a specialty coffee
          scene was budding back home each time they returned to Salt Lake City.

        </div>
        <p>
          Pointing to The Rose Establishment as one of the places pushing the
          coffee scene forward, Price recalls, “I was like, man, this is so cool
          that this exists in Salt Lake…the coffee scene must be catching on
          here!” Price made the decision to found Three Pines in Salt Lake,
          rather than Los Angeles, noting that L.A. had already watched the
          coffee scene progress well beyond the incubation stage. “Salt Lake
          seemed like a good idea. It seemed like a place where I could make a
          mark and sort of do my thing—which is essentially the Handsome way,
          but bring that here [where] that would be a really cool and fresh new
          thing—and it is.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The duo started out catering at events. Their mobile setup serves
          strictly espresso-based drinks for now—exclusively using beans from
          Heart Roasters. The Three Pines cart, crafted by Price in his father’s
          auto garage with the help of his brother, sports a La Marzocco GS3 and
          aNuova Simonelli Mythos One Clima Pro Grinder. After about a month,
          the owner of Liberty Heights Fresh approached them about establishing
          daily hours outside his high-end organic grocery store. The pair felt
          the store, its clientele, and the cart were a good fit, and their
          business has rapidly grown from there.

          Price and Frampton have joined the specialty coffee scene in Salt Lake
          before it’s completely taken off, which comes with its own rewards and
          challenges. Pioneering a food or drink movement before it’s fully
          caught on somewhere is exciting, but there may be a heavier onus to
          acclimate customers to a new approach. “It was kind of tricky to ask
          people their opinions but at the same time kind of educate them,” said
          Price.
        </p>
        <p>
          Price welcomes the friendly dialogue he has with his customers and is
          confident that SLC is prime for good coffee. “This city is so ready
          for it. People are so curious about it and so intrigued. Every time
          they come to the cart they’re like – You’re weighing everything? What
          does that do? What’s that thing? Everyone’s just really interested.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That Salt Lake City is now jonesing for good coffee, having had its
          first few tastes, is evinced by the overwhelmingly positive response
          Three Pines has received. In mid-November, they shuttered their
          regular stint at Liberty Fresh to focus on fitting-out a
          brick-and-mortar shop to open in 2016. Price would like to be able to
          offer drip coffee and food options in a warm space where customers can
          relax. He also wants to run with the educational aspect of his
          business. “I want to do public cuppings and brew classes,” said Price,
          musing on plans for his future space. “I want to be able to offer
          more.”
