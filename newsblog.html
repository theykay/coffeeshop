        <h1>Closing up our Gallivan shop, moving to Main Street</h1>
        <p>
          We've had a lot of good times in our tiny 160 sq. ft. space on
          Gallivan Avenue, but bigger things are on the horizon! We will soon be
          opening our new door at 165 South Main Street. We will have longer
          hours, a large pastry and baked goods selection, a few more beverage
          options, and a whole lot more seating!!! Check back or follow us on
          our social media accounts for updates about opening parties, new
          hours, and to see how the new shop build-out is coming along. Thank
          you, -Nick

        <h1>When Will We Be Open?</h1>
        <p>
          Do you know how annoying it is that I can’t tell you when we plan to
          open? It’s like, I’m about to have a baby, and I can’t tell you when
          she’s due. It’s driving me nuts! Our shop is finally starting to look
          and feel like a shop, so much so that people have been cupping their
          faces and smashing their noses into our windows all morning and
          afternoon. “Come in! Come have a look around,” Nick says and ushers
          them inside, as I rush out with windex and paper towels to wipe away
          the nostril smudges. (You never know when a representative of the
          health department is gonna pop in!) We have finalized our menu. We
          have some exciting beverages to offer you. My favorite right now is
          made by shaking house-made almond milk, vanilla, espresso, and ice
          together in a martini shaker. It’s current title is “ice-shaken
          vanilla almond espresso and milk”, but it doesn’t quite fit on our
          menu right now, so we are working on the name. It is seriously the
          bomb though! Our ceramics shine and twinkle like sunlight on fluffy
          snow. Our first batch of Heart Coffee will arrive in a few days. We
          have organic milk ready and waiting to be picked up. Everything is
          ready. We just have to wait for a few final things... We are going to
          have a little shin dig the night before our Grand Opening. We will be
          serving everything on our menu for FREE. So everyone, please let us
          know what you think! Yes, you'll be able to try the ice-shaken vanilla
          almond espresso and milk. (But only if you say it five times fast
          before you order.) So, watch your inbox closely the next week or so
          and look out for announcements about our shindig and opening day! All
          the best, Three Pines Coffee
