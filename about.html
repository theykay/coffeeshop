      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        A few years ago, Nick and I moved to Los Angeles to pursue music
        careers. When we first arrived, we stopped at Handsome Coffee, a new
        specialty coffee shop located in the arts district.
      </p>
      <p>
        During our visit, the owner happened to need a handy man. Nick's
        background fixing cars at his father's auto body shop made him just the
        man for the job. Perhaps due to Nick's willingness to be helpful, the
        owner offered Nick a position as a barista.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nick didn't know much about coffee, but he learned quickly. I would
        visit him often at the coffee shop, happy to read for hours while
        sipping on a delicious cappuccino he made.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mother called me one afternoon. She always has crazy ideas to share
        with me. I usually take them with a grain of salt. "Meg, you should
        start an all-girl electronic band that performs only at national parks!"
        or "Meg, why don't you start an Ebay company that sells used prom
        dresses?!"
      </p>
      <p>
        This time she had an idea that didn't involve clowns, sequins, or the
        use of live animals, so I listened closely. "Utah needs good coffee
        shops! You are a great businesswoman, and Nick has turned into quite the
        barista. How about the two of you start up your own coffee company?"
        Before I could come up with all my usual objections, a quiet voice
        inside me spoke up...
      </p>
      <div class="about-us-center-text">
        <p>Why not?</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        That night at dinner, I told Nick, "So, my mother had this thought..."
        We both laughed it off, but our conversation kept returning to the idea
        our own coffee shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a week, we purchased a brand new espresso machine, grinders, and
        other coffee gear (worth almost as much as my college tuition!), packed
        our bags, and decided to move back to Salt Lake City.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times during our long drive, I questioned our decision. As I stared
        out at the desert highway, I imagined one of those dusty railroad switch
        operators off in the distance appearing larger and larger as the train
        representing my life approached, chugging comfortably down the route it
        always has. I noticed the blur of his blue cap as I passed him. He
        saluted me and suddenly cranked the lever, sending the train down a
        sharp left turn into the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snapping back to reality with a catchy pop song coming on the radio, I
        felt a sense of calmness come over me, because I realized that we
        couldn't NOT try this. Nick smiled at me and squeezed my hand over the
        center console. Whatever happens, it is guaranteed to be a great
        adventure, and that's enough for us.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
