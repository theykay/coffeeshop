    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      A few years ago, Nick and I moved to Los Angeles to pursue music careers.
      When we first arrived, we stopped at Handsome Coffee, a new specialty
      coffee shop located in the arts district. During our visit, the owner
      happened to need a handy man. Nick's background fixing cars at his
      father's auto body shop made him just the man for the job. Perhaps due to
      Nick's willingness to be helpful, the owner offered Nick a position as a
      barista. Nick didn't know much about coffee, but he learned quickly. I
      would visit him often at the coffee shop, happy to read for hours while
      sipping on a delicious cappuccino he made. My mother called me one
      afternoon. She always has crazy ideas to share with me. I usually take
      them with a grain of salt. "Meg, you should start an all-girl electronic
      band that performs only at national parks!" or "Meg, why don't you start
      an Ebay company that sells used prom dresses?!" This time she had an idea
      that didn't involve clowns, sequins, or the use of live animals, so I
      listened closely. "Utah needs good coffee shops! You are a great
      businesswoman, and Nick has turned into quite the barista. How about the
      two of you start up your own coffee company?" Before I could come up with
      all my usual objections, a quiet voice inside me spoke up... Why not? That
      night at dinner, I told Nick, "So, my mother had this thought..." We both
      laughed it off, but our conversation kept returning to the idea our own
      coffee shop. Within a week, we purchased a brand new espresso machine,
      grinders, and other coffee gear (worth almost as much as my college
      tuition!), packed our bags, and decided to move back to Salt Lake City. At
      times during our long drive, I questioned our decision. As I stared out at
      the desert highway, I imagined one of those dusty railroad switch
      operators off in the distance appearing larger and larger as the train
      representing my life approached, chugging comfortably down the route it
      always has. I noticed the blur of his blue cap as I passed him. He saluted
      me and suddenly cranked the lever, sending the train down a sharp left
      turn into the unknown. Snapping back to reality with a catchy pop song
      coming on the radio, I felt a sense of calmness come over me, because I
      realized that we couldn't NOT try this. Nick smiled at me and squeezed my
      hand over the center console. Whatever happens, it is guaranteed to be a
      great adventure, and that's enough for us. Sincerely, Meg Frampton Three
